        <p class="font1">Computer programming or coding is the composition of sequences of instructions, called
            programs, that computers can follow to perform tasks.[1][2] It involves designing and implementing
            algorithms, step-by-step specifications of procedures, by writing code in one or more programming languages.
            Programmers typically use high-level programming languages that are more easily intelligible to humans than
            machine code, which is directly executed by the central processing unit. Proficient programming usually
            requires expertise in several different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain, details of
            programming languages and generic code libraries, specialized algorithms, and formal logic.

            Auxiliary tasks accompanying and related to programming include analyzing requirements, testing, debugging
            (investigating and fixing problems), implementation of build systems, and management of derived artifacts,
            such as programs' machine code. While these are sometimes considered programming, often the term software
            development is used for this larger overall process â€“ with the terms programming, implementation, and coding
            reserved for the writing and editing of code per se. Sometimes software development is known as software
            engineering, especially when it employs formal methods or follows an engineering design process.
            Different programming languages support different styles of programming (called programming paradigms). The
            choice of language used is subject to many considerations, such as company policy, suitability to task,
            availability of third-party packages, or individual preference. Ideally, the programming language best
            suited for the task at hand will be selected. Trade-offs from this ideal involve finding enough programmers
            who know the language to build a team, the availability of compilers for that language, and the efficiency
            with which programs written in a given language execute. Languages form an approximate spectrum from
            "low-level" to "high-level"; "low-level" languages are typically more machine-oriented and faster to
            execute, whereas "high-level" languages are more abstract and easier to use but execute less quickly. It is
            usually easier to code in "high-level" languages than in "low-level" ones. Programming languages are
            essential for software development. They are the building blocks for all software, from the simplest
            applications to the most sophisticated ones.
